# Project Data

Project data is drawn from the Kaggle train/test datasets as mentioned in the README in the main page.

For Sentiment Analysis, the Vader Sentiment Lexicon, which was pre-trained on much larger text dataset and pre-defined features, was adopted.

For further model development, much larger Twitter dataset with tweets at least 300,000 tweets, is required from Twitter API.
